Technology Stack:
C# & ASP.NET MVC Framework: The application is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework, enabling a scalable and maintainable architecture. The MVC design pattern separates the application into distinct layers—Model, View, and Controller—making it easier to manage and extend features.

LINQ for Data Manipulation: LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is used for querying data from the MSSQL database in a clean and efficient way, allowing for strong integration with the backend and streamlining complex queries with less code.

MSSQL Database: The platform utilizes MSSQL as the primary database for storing user information, workout routines, logs, and community interactions. It ensures secure, efficient, and fast access to the data.

JavaScript & Bootstrap: JavaScript powers the interactive elements of the platform, while Bootstrap ensures the UI is responsive and user-friendly across all devices. Bootstrap is also used to create a modern, visually appealing design that is easy to navigate.
